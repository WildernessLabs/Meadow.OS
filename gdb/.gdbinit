#   Define a single macro that can be called from GDB to get to the point of
#   interest.  This is used by entering the command
#
#   run-to-error
#
#   at the GDB prompt.

#   Change the colour used to show addresses.
#
# set style address foreground yellow

#
#   Set some breakpoints.
#
#   First a simple breakpoint:
#
# b hcom_nx_config_manager.c:2118
#
#   Now a more complex breakpoint.  This will stop at the specified line and then
#   show the current backtrace along with method arguments and local variables.
#
# b mm_malloc.c:138
# command
# nx_bt
# echo \nArguments\n\n
# info arg
# echo \nLocal Variables\n\n
# info local
# echo \nCurrent node\n\n
# p *node

#
#   Turn pagination off - useful when running some of the heap tracing macros
#   and aso may be useful for use with trace files.
#
# set pagination off

#
#   Send the commands to the trace file.  Useful to show the command and the
#   result in the trace file.  Without this you will only get the command result
#   in the file.
#
# set trace-commands on

#
#   Turn logging to file on.  By default the log file will be placed in the
#   same directory as the gdbinit file.
#
# set logging file gdblog.txt
# set logging on
# set trace-commands on

#
#   Show all the breakpoints and their status (along with any commands associated
#   with the breakpoint) to check current status.
