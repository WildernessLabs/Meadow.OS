 *  Task priorities.
 *
 *  The task priorities on the ESP32 are defined as a number between 0 and 24 (inclusive).
 *
 *  Priority 0 is the lowest priority and is used by the idle task.  We should place our
 *  tasks at a higher priority than the idle task but also order them to ensure that the
 *  most commonly used functionality has the highest priority without interfering with the
 *  operating system.  We also need to ensure that the inter-processor communication tasks
 *  are given a high priority to ensure that the system remains responsive.
 *
 *  The priorities below are placed in order from highest to lowest.
