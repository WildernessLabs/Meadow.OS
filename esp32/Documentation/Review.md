## 1. Executive Summary

The Meadow-ESP32 firmware is a well-structured embedded C++ project providing WiFi, Bluetooth, file storage, and POSIX networking services to an STM32 host over SPI/UART. The architecture is clear, documentation is generally thorough, and the overall design is sound for a resource-constrained FreeRTOS target.

However, the codebase carries a significant number of correctness and safety issues, several of which are **critical**. The most pressing concerns are:

- **Mismatched heap allocators** — `pvPortMalloc` / FreeRTOS heap objects are released with `vPortFree` via a utility that wraps `vPortFree`, but `new[]` / `realloc` (stdlib) memory is mixed in, creating undefined behaviour on the FreeRTOS heap.
- **Missing null checks** after allocation calls throughout the SPI and Bluetooth subsystems.
- **Race conditions** in the ThreadPool and singleton implementations.

All 30 currently open issues are referenced and grouped below.

## 3. Security

### 3.3 BLE Security Commented Out

**File:** `BluetoothRequestHandler.cpp`, `GATTSProfileEventHandler`, `ESP_GATTS_CONNECT_EVT`

```cpp
//  esp_ble_set_encryption(param->connect.remote_bda, ESP_BLE_SEC_ENCRYPT_MITM);
```

BLE pairing security is disabled. Any device in range can connect and read/write characteristics.

**Recommendation:** Enable MITM protection if Bluetooth is used in a sensitive context. At minimum, document this as a conscious decision.

---

## 4. Memory Management

### 4.1 Missing Null Checks After Allocations [CRITICAL / #162]

Multiple allocation call sites do not check the returned pointer before use, risking a hard fault.

**`SpiTransportProvider::CreateSpiTransaction`** (`SpiTransportProvider.cpp`, line 314):
```cpp
spi_slave_transaction_t *transaction = static_cast<spi_slave_transaction_t *>(
    pvPortMalloc(sizeof(spi_slave_transaction_t)));
memset(transaction, 0, sizeof(spi_slave_transaction_t));  // crash if nullptr
```

**`SpiTransportProvider::ProcessInboundPacket`** (line 562):
```cpp
uint8_t *payloadBuffer = static_cast<uint8_t *>(pvPortMalloc(packet->PayloadLength));
memcpy(static_cast<void *>(payloadBuffer), ...);  // crash if nullptr
```

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::OnDataWriteRequest`** (line 814–821):
```cpp
Esp32Messaging::BTDataWriteRequest *request = static_cast<...>(pvPortMalloc(...));
request->Handle = handle;  // crash if nullptr
// ...
uint8_t *payload = static_cast<uint8_t *>(pvPortMalloc(payload_length));
Encoders::EncodeBTDataWriteRequest(request, payload);  // crash if nullptr
```

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::GetHandles`** (line 402–407):
```cpp
response.Handles = static_cast<uint8_t *>(pvPortMalloc(response.HandlesLength));
_manager.GetHandles((uint16_t *) response.Handles);  // crash if nullptr

request->Payload = static_cast<uint8_t *>(pvPortMalloc(request->PayloadLength));
Encoders::EncodeBTGetHandlesResponse(&response, request->Payload);  // crash if nullptr
```

**`Encoders::ExtractString`** uses `strcpy` without checking the returned allocation before the copy (though it does check before returning).

**Recommendation:** Add null checks immediately after every `pvPortMalloc`, `heap_caps_calloc`, `strdup`, and `new` call. Return an error code or log and abort if allocation fails.

### 4.2 Mismatched Allocators [CRITICAL / #163, #166, #169]

The project uses multiple heap allocators:
- FreeRTOS: `pvPortMalloc` / `vPortFree`
- DMA-capable: `heap_caps_calloc` / `heap_caps_free`
- C++ operators: `new` / `new[]` / `delete` / `delete[]`
- libc: `realloc` / `free`

`Utils::DeleteAndNullifyPointer` calls `vPortFree`. This is **correct** for memory allocated with `pvPortMalloc`, but **incorrect** for the following cases:

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::GenerateAttributeTable`** (line 342):
```cpp
_attribute_table = new esp_gatts_attr_db_t[count];
```
`_attribute_table` is a C++ `new[]` allocation. `Utils::DeleteAndNullifyPointer` must **not** be called on this pointer; `delete[]` must be used. Since `BluetoothManager::DeleteAllServices` uses `delete[]` for `_valueMap` values, this particular pair is internally consistent, but mixing `new[]` with the rest of the codebase's FreeRTOS allocations remains a maintenance hazard.

**Recommendation:**
- Standardise on `pvPortMalloc` / `vPortFree` for all dynamic allocation.
- Replace `new[]` / `delete[]` in Bluetooth with `pvPortMalloc` / `vPortFree`.
- Replace `Utils::DeleteAndNullifyPointer` on FreeRTOS handles with the correct `vSemaphoreDelete`, `vQueueDelete`, etc.

### 4.3 Memory / Resource Leaks on Error Paths [HIGH / #164]

**`FileSystem::ReadFile`** — If `fopen` succeeds and `fread` returns 0 bytes, `fileData->Contents` is allocated but the status is left as `Failure`. The cleanup at the bottom checks `result != StatusCodes::CompletedOk` to free `fileData->Contents`, so this path is actually handled, but the logic is difficult to follow.

More clearly: if `fopen` fails (`file == NULL`), `fileData->Contents` is allocated but not freed at that point. The cleanup section below does handle it, but the nested conditionals make auditing error-paths very difficult.

**`SpiTransportProvider::PacketReceived`** — When a CRC error occurs:
```cpp
_outboundMessage = Message::CreateOnHeap(messageType, ...);
newTransaction = CreateAcknowledgementTransaction(_outboundMessage, ...);
```
`_outboundMessage` is set here but is never deleted in this code path. On the next call to `PacketAcknowledged`, `_outboundMessage` would be a dangling pointer from the previous CRC error unless the state machine resets cleanly.

**Recommendation:** Use RAII wrappers or at minimum a structured goto-based cleanup pattern to ensure all error paths release resources.

### 4.4 Double-Free and Use-After-Free Risks [HIGH / #165]

**`PacketAcknowledgementReceived`** (`SpiTransportProvider.cpp`):
```cpp
Message::DeleteMessage(incomingMessage);
if (_currentState == WaitingForPacket)
{
    _outboundMessage = nullptr;
    ...
}
```
If `_outboundMessage` and `incomingMessage` happen to point to the same object (not possible by current flow, but defensive programming is important), this would be a double-free.

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::Start`** — `config->Config` is freed with `DeleteAndNullifyPointer`, then `config` itself is freed. If `Config` is null, the null check in `DeleteAndNullifyPointer` handles it, but `config` is passed without checking whether `ExtractBTStackConfig` returned null.

---

## 5. Concurrency and Thread Safety

### 5.1 Race Conditions in ThreadPool and Singleton Patterns [CRITICAL / #167]

**`ThreadPool::Execute`** contains a TOCTOU race:
```cpp
if (xSemaphoreTake(_threadsAvailable, ...) == pdTRUE)
{
    for (uint8_t index = 0; index < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; index++)
    {
        if (_threads[index] && !_threads[index]->IsBusy())
        {
            _threads[index]->Execute(method, parameter);  // ← race window between IsBusy() and Execute()
```
The semaphore guarantees a thread is available, but between `IsBusy()` returning `false` and `Execute()` claiming the thread, another caller on a different task could claim the same thread. `Thread::Execute` does check `_isBusy` under the mutex, so the race is caught there and an exception is thrown — but throwing from a FreeRTOS task is dangerous (see §7.2).

**Singleton pattern** (WiFiRequestHandler, BluetoothRequestHandler, SystemRequestHandler, SpiTransportProvider) all use the pattern:
```cpp
if (_instance != nullptr)
    throw new MultipleInstancesException();
_instance = this;
```
The check and assignment are not atomic. If two tasks simultaneously call the constructor before either sets `_instance`, both will proceed past the guard. This is unlikely in practice (construction happens in `app_main` before tasks are created), but is undefined behaviour.

### 5.2 Unprotected Shared Data Structures [HIGH / #168]

**`WiFiRequestHandler::_pollRequests`** is a `std::map` accessed from multiple tasks:
```cpp
std::map<uint32_t, struct pollfd *> WiFiRequestHandler::_pollRequests;
SemaphoreHandle_t WiFiRequestHandler::_pollRequestListMutex = NULL;
```
`_pollRequestListMutex` is created, which is good, but callers must verify that every access to `_pollRequests` is consistently guarded by this mutex. Any unguarded access is a data race on a non-trivially destructible STL container (heap corruption risk).

**`BluetoothManager::_valueMap`** is a `std::map<uint16_t, length_val_s>` accessed from the GATTS event handler (`ESP_GATTS_READ_EVT`, `ESP_GATTS_WRITE_EVT`) and from the FreeRTOS task handling STM32 requests. No mutex protects this map.

### 5.4 Bluetooth Callback Lifecycle [HIGH / #183]

Bluetooth callbacks (`GATTSProfileEventHandler`, `GAPEventHandler`, `EventHandlerHelper`) are registered as static C callbacks with the ESP-IDF BLE stack. They access `GetInstance()` to retrieve the singleton. If `BluetoothRequestHandler` is destroyed (or `Stop` is called) while a BLE event is in flight, `GetInstance()` returns `nullptr` and the callback dereferences it:

```cpp
GetInstance()->RaiseEvent(...);  // crash if _instance == nullptr
esp_ble_gap_start_advertising(GetInstance()->GetAdvertisingParameters());
```

**Recommendation:** Before unregistering the BLE stack or destroying the handler, ensure all in-flight callbacks have completed. Set `_instance = nullptr` only after `esp_bluedroid_disable` / `esp_bluedroid_deinit` have returned.

### 5.5 WiFi Credentials Not Mutex-Protected [MEDIUM / #184]

```cpp
char *WiFiRequestHandler::_defaultAccessPoint = nullptr;
char *WiFiRequestHandler::_password = nullptr;
```

These static members are assigned in `SetDefaultAccessPoint` and `SetPassword`, which free the old value and assign a new `strdup`-allocated string. If one task reads `_password` while another task calls `SetPassword`, the reader may access freed memory.

**Recommendation:** Protect all reads and writes to `_defaultAccessPoint` and `_password` with a dedicated mutex (or reuse `_connectedNodesListMutex` if appropriate).

---

## 6. Code Correctness

### 6.1 Null Dispatcher / Callback Pointer Dereference [HIGH / #170]

**`FileSystem::ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `DeleteFile`, `ListFiles`, `Format`** all call:
```cpp
_messageDispatcher->QueueMessageForStm32(message);
```
without checking whether `_messageDispatcher` is null. `FileSystem` has a private default constructor that sets `_messageDispatcher = nullptr`. If the default constructor is ever used (e.g. reflectively or inadvertently), this is a crash.

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::SetCurrentValueForAttributeHandle`** (line 430):
```cpp
Esp32Messaging::BTServerDataSet *ds = Encoders::ExtractBTServerDataSet(request->Payload);
TRACE_MESSAGE("... %" PRIu32 " bytes to 0x%04" PRIx16, ds->SetDataLength, ds->Handle);
```
`ds` is not null-checked before dereferencing.

### 6.2 Buffer Overflow with `strcpy` and `inet_ntoa` [MEDIUM / #171]

**`WiFiRequestHandler.cpp`**, static IP configuration:
```cpp
char ip[INET_ADDRSTRLEN], subnet[INET_ADDRSTRLEN], gateway[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];
strcpy(ip, inet_ntoa(accessPointInformation->IpAddress));
strcpy(subnet, inet_ntoa(accessPointInformation->SubnetMask));
strcpy(gateway, inet_ntoa(accessPointInformation->Gateway));
```

`inet_ntoa` returns a pointer to a static internal buffer. Calling it three times in sequence means the second call overwrites the buffer used by the first, and the third overwrites the second's result. By the time `strcpy(subnet, ...)` completes, `ip` still contains the correct value (copied), but calling `inet_ntoa` three times in a row with a single static buffer is fragile, especially in a multithreaded context.

**Recommendation:** Use `esp_ip4addr_ntoa` (reentrant) or `inet_ntop` with explicit buffers.

### 6.4 TOCTOU Race in File Operations [MEDIUM / #174]

**`FileSystem::ReadFile`** and **`FileSystem::ListFiles`** use:
```cpp
if (stat(s.c_str(), &fileInfo) == 0)
{
    // ...
    FILE *file = fopen(s.c_str(), "r");
```
The file could be deleted, truncated, or replaced between the `stat` and `fopen` calls. The correct pattern is to `fopen` first, then use `fstat` on the file descriptor to obtain the size.

### 6.5 Large Stack Allocation in GATTS Event Handler [MEDIUM / #159]

**`BluetoothRequestHandler::GATTSProfileEventHandler`**, `ESP_GATTS_READ_EVT`:
```cpp
esp_gatt_rsp_t rsp;
memset(&rsp, 0, sizeof(esp_gatt_rsp_t));
```

`esp_gatt_rsp_t` contains a 517-byte array (`attr_value.value[ESP_GATT_MAX_ATTR_LEN]`). Allocating this on the GATTS event handler stack risks a stack overflow in the BLE controller task, which typically has a small stack.

Additionally, `GetCurrentValueForAttributeHandle` does not indicate success or failure. If the handle is unknown, `pLen` is set to 0 and `pData` is set to `NULL` locally (the assignment is to the local parameter, not the caller's pointer — this is a bug):

```cpp
else
{
    *pLen = 0;
    pData = NULL;  // ← Bug: modifies local copy only; caller's pointer is unchanged
}
```

**Issue #159 recommendation:** Allocate `esp_gatt_rsp_t` on the heap and return a pointer from `GetCurrentValueForAttributeHandle`, returning `nullptr` on failure (handle not found).

### 6.7 SPI State Machine Cannot Recover from Unknown State [HIGH / #176]

**`SpiTransportProvider::ProcessMessages`**, default case:
```cpp
default:
    ERROR_MESSAGE("ProcessMessages: Unhandled state: %s", SpiStateString(_currentState));
    break;
```

After the `break`, `newTransaction` is `nullptr`. The `Task` loop then calls `ProcessMessages(nullptr)` on the next iteration. `spi_slave_queue_trans` is then called with a null transaction, causing either an assertion in the ESP-IDF or undefined behaviour.

**Recommendation:** In the default case, reset `_currentState` to `WaitingForPacket` and create a fresh transaction:
```cpp
default:
    ERROR_MESSAGE("ProcessMessages: Unhandled state, resetting to WaitingForPacket.");
    _currentState = WaitingForPacket;
    newTransaction = CreateSpiTransaction(nullptr);
    break;
```

### 6.8 Bluetooth Event Handler Stub [MEDIUM / #185]

The `EventHandlerHelper` function (referenced by the BLE stack event registration) is either absent or a no-op. Important state changes — pairing completion, MTU negotiation, GAP security events — are silently discarded. The `GAPEventHandler` only handles advertising-related events.

**Recommendation:** Implement handlers for security and pairing events, or add explicit log messages for all unhandled events so they can be identified during testing.

---

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.2 `throw new` in Embedded / FreeRTOS Context [HIGH]

Throughout the codebase, exceptions are thrown using `throw new`:
```cpp
throw new ThreadPoolException("Cannot create mutex for thread.");
throw new MultipleInstancesException();
```

This pattern allocates the exception object on the heap with `new` (which on the ESP32 calls `pvPortMalloc`). The exception must then be caught with `catch(ExceptionType *e)` and the caller must call `delete e`. If no matching `catch` exists, or if the catch handler neglects to delete, the exception object leaks permanently.

More importantly, FreeRTOS tasks do not automatically unwind the C++ stack on exception, and the ESP-IDF documentation advises against relying on C++ exception handling in task context. Some of these throws occur inside constructors called before any `catch` block exists.

**Recommendation:**
- Either throw by value (`throw ThreadPoolException(...)`) and catch by reference, as per C++ best practice.
- Or, since this is an embedded system, replace exceptions with error-return codes and/or `ESP_ERROR_CHECK`-style logging followed by `esp_restart()` on unrecoverable errors.

### 7.5 `SendingData` Parameter Unused

**`SpiTransportProvider.cpp`**:
```cpp
bool SpiTransportProvider::SendingData(SpiStates state)
{
    return ((_currentState == AcknowledgingPacket) || ...);
}
```

The `state` parameter is declared but the method uses `_currentState` directly. This is dead code; either the parameter should be used (`state == ...`) or the method should not take a parameter. The call site passes `_currentState` which makes the parameter effectively ignored.

---

## 8. Code Style and Conventions

### 8.3 `NULL` vs `nullptr` [LOW / #179, #187]

The codebase uses `NULL` in at least 426 locations (vs `nullptr` in 212 locations). The project convention specifies `nullptr`. All `NULL` usages in C++ code should be replaced.

Notable examples:
- `ThreadPool::_threadsAvailable = NULL;`
- `_pollRequestListMutex = NULL;`
- `SpiTransportProvider::_synchronisationTaskHandle = NULL;`

### 8.5 Unused Variables and Dead Code [LOW / #181]

- `static int __attribute__((unused)) test_value = 0;` in `BluetoothManager.cpp` (see §7.6).
- `SendingData(SpiStates state)` has an unused `state` parameter (see §7.5).
- Commented-out code blocks throughout `SpiTransportProvider.cpp` (heap tracing) and `BluetoothRequestHandler.cpp` (security, service handle) should either be removed or converted to conditional compilation.

---

## 9. Test Coverage

### 9.2 Coverage Gaps

- **SPI state machine** — No tests for the SPI transport layer in isolation. The mock transport provider (`MockTransportProvider`) exists but appears under-used.
- **ThreadPool** — No tests for the thread pool under concurrent load or for the semaphore timeout path.
- **Memory allocation failure** — No tests inject allocation failures to verify null-check paths.
- **Bluetooth lifecycle** — `test_bluetooth.cpp` exists; it should cover the destroy-during-callback scenario (§5.4).
