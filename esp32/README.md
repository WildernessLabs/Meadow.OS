# Meadow-ESP32

[![Build](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow-ESP32/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow-ESP32/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains the code that will run on the ESP32 to support communication and facilitate the provision of services to NuttX and Meadow.Core.

Services are provided to the STM32 through the SPI interface connected to the STM32 and the ESP32 chips.

## Quick Start

### Building

```bash
# Install ESP-IDF 5.3+ (via VS Code extension or manually)
./build.sh --build          # Build release version
./build.sh --develop        # Build with debug symbols
./build.sh --help           # See all options
```

See [Building the System](Documentation/Building.md) for detailed instructions.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd test
cp secrets.template secrets.h   # Add WiFi credentials
./build.sh --build --flash --monitor
# Select test from interactive menu
```

See [Testing Guide](Documentation/Testing.md) for detailed information.

## Architecture

The system uses a message-based architecture with FreeRTOS tasking:

- **WiFi**: Connectivity and POSIX socket API
- **Bluetooth**: BLE service and characteristic management  
- **System**: File storage, NVS configuration, threading
- **Messaging**: SPI protocol and message dispatch

See [Project Structure](Documentation/ProjectStructure.md) for detailed component information.
